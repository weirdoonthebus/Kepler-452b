Kepler-452b
===========

![Font Preview Graphic](./glyphs-0.jpg)


The Design
----------

Kepler-452b is a futuristic, minimalist font family. Each character has been carefully crafted for optimal legibility and style.



The Name
--------

Named after the rocky exoplanet Kepler-452b in the constelation Cygnus, it is one of the most Earth-like planets to be found (often called Earth 2.0).



To Do
-----

1. Bold + Italic Variants.

3. Additional language support. *I think Crylic characters will look particuly nice with this design.*

2. Submit to Google Fonts.
